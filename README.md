# Evernote markdown sync

## Overview

I love [Evernote](https://evernote.com/intl/de/pricing/) as it syncs my notes between all my devices. I also love markdown as it is easy to write and also supports syntax highlighting which is not supported by Evernote. Thirdly I love git for keeping track of changes to my work.

So I searched for a way to write my notes as markdown files, store them in git and sync that repository to my Evernote account automatically whenever I change a markdown file and commit it in git.

## Architecture

Fortunately Evernote provides and API and also SDKs for various languages.

* Use timestamps of notes and git files to find out if update is required
